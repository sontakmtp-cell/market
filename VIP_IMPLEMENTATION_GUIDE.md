# VIP Features Implementation Guide

## 1. Database Migrations

### Required Tables
The VIP functionality uses the existing `marketplace_projects` table with additional columns.

### Migration Files Created:
1. **Full Migration**: `20250912000003_add_vip_features_to_marketplace_projects.sql`
   - Complete VIP implementation with expiration, payment tracking, and triggers
   - Includes views and helper functions

2. **Simple Migration**: `20250912000004_add_basic_vip_columns.sql` (Recommended)
   - Basic VIP columns only: `displayType`, `vipFeePaid`, `vipActivatedAt`
   - Minimal implementation for immediate use

### To Apply Migration:
```bash
# Copy the migration file to your Supabase project
# Then run in Supabase SQL Editor:
\i supabase/migrations/20250912000004_add_basic_vip_columns.sql
```

## 2. New Columns Added

| Column | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `displayType` | text | 'standard' | 'standard' or 'vip' |
| `vipFeePaid` | numeric | 0 | Amount paid for VIP (VND) |
| `vipActivatedAt` | timestamp | null | When VIP was activated |

## 6. Database Queries

ORDER BY vipActivatedAt DESC;
```

### Get All Projects (VIP First):
```sql
SELECT * FROM marketplace_projects 
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY 
  CASE WHEN displayType = 'vip' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,
  vipActivatedAt DESC NULLS LAST,
  created_at DESC;
```

### VIP Revenue Report:
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_vip_projects,
  SUM(vipFeePaid) as total_revenue,
  AVG(vipFeePaid) as avg_fee
FROM marketplace_projects 
WHERE displayType = 'vip';
```

## 7. Next Steps

## 8. Testing

### Manual Testing:
1. Create new project and select VIP
2. Verify VIP card appears with 3D effects
3. Check VIP projects appear first in listing
4. Test responsive design on mobile

### Database Testing:
```sql
-- Test VIP upgrade
UPDATE marketplace_projects 
SET displayType = 'vip', vipFeePaid = 10000, vipActivatedAt = NOW()
WHERE id = 1;

-- Verify sorting
SELECT id, title, displayType, vipActivatedAt 
FROM marketplace_projects 
ORDER BY displayType DESC, vipActivatedAt DESC;
```

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **VIP cards not showing**: Check `displayType` column value
2. **3D effects not working**: Verify CSS import in JobCardVIP.jsx
3. **Sorting not working**: Ensure index exists on `displayType`
4. **Mobile issues**: Check responsive CSS breakpoints

### Debug Queries:
```sql
-- Check VIP data
SELECT id, title, displayType, vipFeePaid, vipActivatedAt 
FROM marketplace_projects 
WHERE displayType = 'vip';

-- Check data types
\d marketplace_projects
```
